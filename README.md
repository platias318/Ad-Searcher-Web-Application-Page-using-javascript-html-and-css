This project was an assignment for the fourth year of University , where we where asked to create a web application page themed around "Ad Searching", using HTML/CSS and, mostly, JavaScript, in order for the 
page to dynamically refresh it's page components by requesting data from a server we built. We make use of the Handlebars library, the node.js library and the fetch API for the requests.
